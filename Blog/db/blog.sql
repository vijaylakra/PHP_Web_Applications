(5, 1, 'Vijay Lakra', '<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard the stories about the mega-successful who wake up early every day and conquer the world before most people put the coffee on. But what about the other time of day that plays an equally important role? What are successful people doing right before bed? Do you want to know the secret? They set themselves up to have an even more productive day tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are six bedtime habits of highly successful people.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Read for an hour</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates is an avid reader. Each night before bed, he spends an hour reading a book, ranging on topics from politics to current events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the obvious benefits of gaining new knowledge, reading daily has also been shown to reduce stress and improve memory. A<a href="http://www.kumon.co.uk/blog/reading-reduces-stress-levels/" target="_blank">&nbsp;2009 study from the University of Essex</a>&nbsp;revealed that reading for as little as six minutes a day can reduce stress levels by up to 68%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another big benefit from cracking open a good book on a nightly basis is that it can improve the long term health of your brain. Every time you read, it&rsquo;s like a mental workout for your mind.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2355212/Reading-help-save-memory-It-slows-decline-brain-power-say-scientists.html" target="_blank">This study performed in Britain</a>&nbsp;showed that people who stimulated their minds through activities like reading, reduced cognitive decline by an average of 32% as they got older in age.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Unplug</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After passing out from exhaustion and injuring her head to the tune of five stitches, Arianna Huffington has been an evangelist for &ldquo;unplugging&rdquo;. Every night before bed, she puts her phone in another room so she&rsquo;s not distracted by it before bed. And science proves that she might be onto something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/%C2%A0http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2577824/Why-NEVER-mobile-bedroom.html#ixzz3CAEyr7eS" target="_blank">Dr Charles Czeisler,</a>&nbsp;a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard University, the bright lights produced by our cell phone screens disrupt our bodies natural sleep rhythm and actually &ldquo;trick&rdquo; our bodies into thinking it&rsquo;s daytime. Those bright lights send a message to our brains that prevents certain chemicals from being released, causing us to have a much harder time going to sleep. So, if you want a good night&rsquo;s rest, stash your phone in another room.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Take a walk</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The busy CEO of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/bufferapp.com" target="_blank">Buffer</a>&nbsp;likes to unwind with a brisk walk right before bed. He uses his walks&nbsp;to turn off his thoughts about work, and slowly work his self into a &ldquo;state of tiredness&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a busy person always on the go, Joel&rsquo;s late night walk routine could be perfect way to unwind after a stressful day. And aside from the obvious health benefits of daily walk, there a couple of surprising bonuses that come along as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/april/walking-vs-sitting-042414.html" target="_blank">One study revealed</a>&nbsp;that walking can increase creativity. When you&rsquo;re walking, your mind isn&rsquo;t working as vigorously, which &ldquo;opens up the free flow&nbsp;of ideas.&rdquo; So if you&rsquo;ve got a tough problem you haven&rsquo;t been able to solve, maybe a nice, night time stroll is all you need to find the perfect, creative solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Meditate</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The media maven has long supported the idea of regular meditation. No doubt, Ms. Winfrey has a schedule that keeps her mighty busy, and what better way to unwind at the end of a stressful day, than with a focused meditation session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s often times&nbsp;a stigma surrounding meditation, and there has always been a debate as to whether mediation is actually helpful. But when&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/mindfulness-meditation-may-ease-anxiety-mental-stress-201401086967" target="_blank">a 2014 study</a>&nbsp;took a look at over 19,000 cases involving mediation, the results were clear. Meditation was found to help reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and pain. So regardless of one&rsquo;s view of mediation, you can&rsquo;t argue with the results.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. Get creative</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2006, Vera Wang stated to Fortune that her nightly routine includes, &ldquo;a fair amount of designing &mdash; at least conceptually if not literally.&rdquo; Sometimes, the quiet of the night can be the perfect remedy for a creative block.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s even more surprising is that there&rsquo;s a study that actually shows night time can be the perfect time for creativity, even if you&rsquo;re tired from a long day.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sleepy-brains-think-freely/" target="_blank">A study from Albion College</a>&nbsp;revealed that, &ldquo;tasks requiring creative insight was consistently better during their nonoptimal times of day.&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So if you&rsquo;re a morning person (raises hand), then your most creative ideas will come right before bed. Researchers believe this is true because your mind is less restrained at night. Your ability to make logical connections worsens, but it works in your favor because you&rsquo;re able to make connections you wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. Plan the next day</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The American Express CEO likes to manage his time, and he does so by ending his nights in a very simple way. He plans out three things he wants to accomplish for the following day. That way, he can wake up in the morning, and get to work on his most important tasks, right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/edu/83/3/405/" target="_blank">This study from the early 90&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;supports Chenault&rsquo;s strange addiction with planning. Researchers followed a group of students from their high school years, until four years later at the end of their college careers. The researchers tested these students on their time management skills in high school, and when they caught up with those students four years later, they made a shocking discovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The students with better time management skills, had higher college GPA&rsquo;s then their peers who had higher SAT scores. Basically, time management played a bigger role in their academic success than actual scholastic aptitude.</p>\r\n', '2015-10-27 11:17:00', '6 Habits Of Highly Successful People Before Bedtime', 'Productivity'),
(6, 11, 'Joey', '<p>In the past,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitalberg.com/" target="_blank">if you wanted to start a dot-com company,</a>&nbsp;investors would shy away from you. They assumed you would fail. In the early days of the Internet, many dot-com companies did just that. They spiked with great sales in the beginning then promptly nose-dived and are no longer in business. Today, however, the exact opposite is happening. If you aren&rsquo;t online, you are doomed to fail. The companies that are based solely online are taking the world by storm and are successful. E-commerce is a subset of this trend, but it is becoming more and more common every day. Here are some reasons why small business owners embrace e-commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Your Store Will Go Everywhere</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a brick-and-mortar shop, you have a limited number of people who can come through your store. Even if you are open 24 hours, you can&rsquo;t reach as many people as you can with an E-commerce site. Also, you have global customers, but with a physical store, you only have access to customers in the local area.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Your Shoppers Will Enjoy Convenience&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are sales expert you know that customers want to be able to buy whatever they want with a click of the button. With an online store they don&rsquo;t have to worry about whether the store is open. They don&rsquo;t have to worry if they are wearing clothes or their pajamas. They can have their purchases sent directly to their doorstep.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Your Overhead is Low</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When you own a store, you have to pay employees, electric, water, rent and insurance. You don&rsquo;t have any of those expenses with an E-commerce site. You have to pay for the site, logistics and possibly warehouse employees. You might also have to pay for the company that ships your goods, but these costs are considerably less than if you had a store.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Your Products Can Sell Cheaper</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You can afford to lower your price, which attracts more customers. You still will make a huge profit, but the margins are lower. You would make up in volume what you lose in store sales. And, in stores, you have to mark up your prices so high because of overhead and other factors, such as theft. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about theft with&nbsp;an E-commerce site. Online sales allow you to be creative&nbsp;<a href="http://www.matchzup.com/" target="_blank">with your specials and discounts too</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>You Can Benefit From Affiliate Marketing</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>What if you had an E-commerce site and were asked to put some of your products on someone else&rsquo;s site as well? You would rake in tremendous sales. Even with the small commission you would pay the other person, you would get twice the number of customers. And, you can offer to pick up other people&rsquo;s products for your site with a small fee. You will help the other company which will help you. Everyone wins.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Your Store Is Like A Supermarket</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you shop in a supermarket, you can buy almost everything. At stores like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.matchzup.com/target.com/" target="_blank">Target</a>&nbsp;you can get everything. This means people can take their time, browse the shelves and pick what they need without ever having to go to another store. The same is true in E-commerce, but the selling space isn&rsquo;t limited by the physical space of a store. You can find whatever you need on an e-commerce shopping site from clothes to automotive products. Your customers will spend more time shopping on your site, which equates to more sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>You&rsquo;ll Benefit From The Big Mobile Buying Trend</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the latest trend in E-commerce, business owners are focusing on mobile marketing because smart phones are driving sales in retail. People are using their phones to shop, tell friends about their finds and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.elitepersonalfinance.com/citibusiness-credit-card/" target="_blank">looking up reviews</a>on products or services. This trend is assisting the growth of E-commerce&rsquo;s popularity. People would rather hit a button on their phones to buy something than to drive to the store. Businesses are eating up the profits and making their sites better.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Your Shoppers Can Buy Online, Return To Store</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you take notice of customers behavior nowadays, many people enjoy having the option of buying a product online and picking it up in a store/ returning it to a store. This is all about convenience. People don&rsquo;t have to wait two weeks to receive their products. And, if they don&rsquo;t like it, they don&rsquo;t have to worry about the merchandise return requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Your Shoppers Will Find the Unique Products They Want</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to buy something specific, such as an antique dinner plate, you will have more options online than at a local mall. You might not even be able find what you are looking for&nbsp;at a physical antique store.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>You&rsquo;ll Be Able To Offer Discounts and Deals&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you own a store, you can offer a sale to draw customers to your place of business, but every other store is doing the same thing. Today, shoppers check online for discounts and deals. They search for the store with the best sale and go there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, remember that when you are building your E-commerce site, you want to work with companies who understand the industry as you definitely don&rsquo;t want a website that will crash.</p>\r\n', '2015-10-27 11:28:32', 'This Is Why Everyone Is Going For E-commerce Business', 'Entrepreneur '),

Having an orchestra perform at a gathering or function was something only the rich could do. Fast forward to this day and age, it has more or less remained that way &ndash; but with the advent of technology and music streaming platforms, it is easier than ever to access this otherwise &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that it&rsquo;s more accessible for everyone, it&rsquo;s great to know that classical music boasts some amazing benefits for your mood, brain, and physical performance just to name a few!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a closer look at some benefits of listening to classical music:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1. Brain Boost!</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There is something called the &ldquo;Mozart Effect,&rdquo; which made many people believe that listening to music, particularly classical music, made you smarter. Well, it&rsquo;s not that simple and clear cut, several studies have shown a similar trend. In a&nbsp;study done by Chakravarthi Kanduri,&nbsp;Computational Biology Researcher at the University of Helsinki, participants were split into two focus groups. The first had musical experience, and the second did not. In the end, Kanduri concluded, &ldquo;listening to classical music enhanced the activity of genes that are mainly related to reward and pleasure, cognitive functions and proper brain function.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2.&nbsp;<strong>Healing Properties.&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Music therapy has been used in a variety of medical fields since the 1800s.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0021-75572006000300006&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=en" target="_blank">Studies</a>&nbsp;have shown that soothing classical music is often played in post-anesthesia units because of its ability to improve comfort and reduce pain.&nbsp;This is due to the effect of the music on the brain, whereby it makes the person focus on the sounds rather than the physical pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3.&nbsp;<strong>Stress-Relief and Mood Changer.</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling sad or overwhelmed, take a few moments of your day to listen to some classical music. Just like its healing properties, it has a tremendous affect on mood and stress, and has&nbsp;been proven to have the same physiological affects as a massage. You know when you&rsquo;re in the club turning up on a Saturday night, it gets too crazy and you need to take a step outside? Well, classical music has the opposite effect that that loud, aggressive, heavy beat music has on you. Club music can encourage stress and anxiety while classical music calms you down and improves your mood.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4.&nbsp;<strong>You&rsquo;ll fall asleep in 5 seconds.</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, not really &ndash; but because classical music is so potent in calming the mind, your body naturally follows and also enters a more relaxed state. This has proven extremely effective with people suffering from insomnia and other&nbsp;<a href="http://www.additudemag.com/slideshow/163/slide-1.html" target="_blank">disorders</a>. Classical, along with white noise and natural sounds, are favorites for therapists to use when conducting sleep therapy. Substitute your pills and other sleep &ldquo;aids&rdquo; for some classical music!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5.&nbsp;<strong>Physical Push.&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&rsquo;re in the gym, you bump your favorite type of music to get you in the zone as you&rsquo;re going through your reps. When you&rsquo;re running, the music keeps you going and gives a little push when&nbsp;you&rsquo;re about to give in. I certainly need my music when I&rsquo;m running or in the gym and guys like&nbsp;<a href="http://usatodayhss.com/2012/elite-football-prospect-turns-to-classical-music-before-games" target="_blank">Austin Roberts</a>&nbsp;agree with me. There have been studies that have shown a positive correlation between increased physical performance and any type of music. For some it&rsquo;s classical and for others, it&rsquo;s heavy metal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Classical is no longer &ldquo;high brow&rdquo; music, but music that offers an amazing range&nbsp;of benefits. I think that sleeping better and faster alone is worth starting to listen to classical music, but it offers all the things mentioned above and then some.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start and end your day with some Mozart, Bach, or Vivaldi and reap those benefits.</p>\r\n', '2015-10-27 11:29:46', 'Amazing Benefits Of Listening to Classical Music', '    Lifestyle, music'),

A decade back I loved a girl or I would say I still love her but could never confess. All my thinking is rooted at her and I know she can never be mine. I fabricated deep conversations with her about life and universe. I used to tell her the &quot;small&quot; stories about how &quot;big&quot; the universe was while I was reading the book&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything" target="_blank">wikipedia.org</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything" target="_blank">A Short History of Nearly Everything</a>. She got amazed when I told her that a grain of sand on any beach was comparable to the part of sky which contains at least 1 billion stars or more. Ironically she never used to believe me.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile reading some very famous quotes from illustrious authors like H.D. Thoreau like&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&nbsp;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nI used to ask her if she could be true to me forever. I was never sure I why I did. I was finding mystical happiness or contentment probably. We used to go for long walks holding our hands together. Most of the time we were talking but when we used to be silent, the silence talked the most. There was some charismatic energy flowing from her hand to my soul. I used to hug her tightly when I used to return from office after a taxing day. Those hugs were simply rejuvenating and always I used to take her promise never to leave me. Only then I used to unbuckle the ring of my hands resting on her waist.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI never found her. I am hallucinating. But these intimate conversations with someone I loved deeply brought me the joy no other thing would ever get. An illusion. An epiphany. A treasure.</p>\r\n', '2015-10-27 22:46:22', 'What I imagine?', 'Ray of Dope'),

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The truth does not cease to exist when it is ignored.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know how you can hear something a hundred times in a hundred different ways before it finally gets through to you?&nbsp; The ten truths listed below fall firmly into that category &ndash; life lessons that many of us likely learned years ago, and have been reminded of ever since, but for whatever reason, haven&rsquo;t fully grasped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This, my friends, is my attempt at helping all of us, myself included, &ldquo;get it&rdquo; and &ldquo;remember it&rdquo; once and for all&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1.&nbsp; The average human life is relatively short.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We know deep down that life is short, and that death will happen to all of us eventually, and yet we are infinitely surprised when it happens to someone we know.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like walking up a flight of stairs with a distracted mind, and misjudging the final step.&nbsp; You expected there to be one more stair than there is, and so you find yourself off balance for a moment, before your mind shifts back to the present moment and how the world really is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LIVE your life TODAY!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t ignore death, but don&rsquo;t be afraid of it either.&nbsp; Be afraid of a life you never lived because you were too afraid to take action.&nbsp; Death is not the greatest loss in life.&nbsp; The greatest loss is what dies inside you while you&rsquo;re still alive.&nbsp; Be bold.&nbsp; Be courageous.&nbsp; Be scared to death, and then take the next step anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2.&nbsp; You will only ever live the life you create for yourself.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your life is yours alone.&nbsp; Others can try to persuade you, but they can&rsquo;t decide for you.&nbsp; They can walk with you, but not in your shoes.&nbsp; So make sure the path you&nbsp;decide to walk aligns with your own intuition and desires, and don&rsquo;t be scared to switch paths or pave a new one when it makes sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, it&rsquo;s always better to be at the bottom of the ladder you want to climb than the top of the one you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Be productive and patient.&nbsp; And realize that patience is not about waiting, but the ability to keep a good attitude while working hard for what you believe in.&nbsp; This is your life, and it is made up entirely of your choices.&nbsp; May your actions speak louder than your words.&nbsp; May your life preach louder than your lips.&nbsp; May your success be your noise in the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if life only teaches you one thing, let it be that taking a passionate leap is always worth it.&nbsp; Even if you have no idea where you&rsquo;re going to land, be brave enough to step up to the edge of the unknown, and listen to your heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>(Angel and I discuss this in more detail in the &ldquo;Passion and Growth&rdquo; chapter of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.marcandangel.com/book/">1,000 Little Things Happy, Successful People Do Differently</a>.)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3.&nbsp; Being busy does NOT mean being productive.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Busyness isn&rsquo;t a virtue, nor is it something to respect.&nbsp; Though we all have seasons of crazy schedules, very few of us have a legitimate need to be busy ALL the time.&nbsp; We simply don&rsquo;t know how to live within our means, prioritize properly, and say no when we should.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being busy rarely equates to productivity these days.&nbsp; Just take a quick look around.&nbsp; Busy people outnumber productive people by a wide margin.&nbsp; Busy people are rushing all over the place, and running late half of the time.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re heading to work, conferences, meetings, social engagements, etc.&nbsp; They barely have enough free time for family get-togethers and they rarely get enough sleep.&nbsp; Yet, emails are shooting out of their smart phones like machine gun bullets, and their day planners are jammed to the brim with obligations.&nbsp; Their busy schedule gives them an elevated sense of importance.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s all an illusion.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re like hamsters running on a wheel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though being busy can make us feel more alive than anything else for a moment, the sensation is not sustainable long term.&nbsp; We will inevitably, whether tomorrow or on our deathbed, come to wish that we spent less time in the buzz of busyness and more time actually living a purposeful life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4.&nbsp; Some kind of failure always occurs before success.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Most mistakes are unavoidable.&nbsp; Learn to forgive yourself.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not a problem to make them.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only a problem if you never learn from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re too afraid of failure, you can&rsquo;t possibly do what needs to be done to be successful.&nbsp; The solution to this problem is making friends with failure.&nbsp; You want to know the difference between a master and a beginner?&nbsp; The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried.&nbsp; Behind every great piece of art is a thousand failed attempts to make it, but these attempts are simply never shown to us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom line:&nbsp; Just because it&rsquo;s not happening now, doesn&rsquo;t mean it never will.&nbsp; Sometimes things have to go very wrong before they can be right.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>(Read&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060594896/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060594896&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=marandang-20" target="_blank">The Success Principles</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=marandang-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0060594896" style="height:1px; width:1px" />.)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5.&nbsp; Thinking and doing are two very different things.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Success never comes to look for you while you wait around thinking about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are what you do, not what you say you&rsquo;ll do.&nbsp; Knowledge is basically useless without action.&nbsp; Good things don&rsquo;t come to those who wait; they come to those who work on meaningful goals.&nbsp; Ask yourself what&rsquo;s really important and then have the courage to build your life around your answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And remember, if you wait until you feel 100% ready to begin, you&rsquo;ll likely be waiting the rest of your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t have to wait for an apology to forgive.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Life gets much easier when you learn to accept all the apologies you never got.&nbsp; The key is to be thankful for every experience &ndash; positive or negative.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s taking a step back and saying, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.marcandangel.com/2014/01/08/8-things-to-remember-when-everything-goes-wrong/">Thank you for the lesson</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s realizing that grudges from the past are a perfect waste of today&rsquo;s happiness, and that holding one is like letting unwanted company live rent free in your head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forgiveness is a promise &ndash; one you want to keep.&nbsp; When you forgive someone you are making a promise not to hold the unchangeable past against your present self.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with freeing a criminal of his or her crime, and everything to do with freeing yourself of the burden of being an eternal victim.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7.&nbsp; Some people are simply the wrong match for you.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You will only ever be as great as the people you surround yourself with, so be brave enough to let go of those who keep bringing you down.&nbsp; You shouldn&rsquo;t force connections with people who constantly make you feel less than amazing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If someone makes you feel uncomfortable and insecure every time you&rsquo;re with them, for whatever reason, they&rsquo;re probably not close friend material.&nbsp; If they make you feel like you can&rsquo;t be yourself, or if they make you &ldquo;less than&rdquo; in any way, don&rsquo;t pursue a connection with them.&nbsp; If you feel emotionally drained after hanging out with them or get a small hit of anxiety when you are reminded of them, listen to your intuition.&nbsp; There are so many &ldquo;right people&rdquo; for you, who energize you and inspire you to be your best self.&nbsp; It makes no sense to force it with people who are the wrong match for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not other people&rsquo;s job to love you; it&rsquo;s yours.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to be nice to others, but it&rsquo;s even more important to be nice to yourself.&nbsp; You really have to love yourself to get anything done in this world.&nbsp; So make sure you don&rsquo;t start seeing yourself through the eyes of those who don&rsquo;t value you.&nbsp; Know your worth, even if they don&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, let someone love you just the way you are &ndash; as flawed as you might be, as unattractive as you sometimes feel, and as incomplete as you think you are.&nbsp; Yes, let someone love you despite all of this, and let that someone be YOU.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>(Read&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1478121734/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1478121734&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=marandang-20" target="_blank">Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=marandang-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1478121734" style="height:1px; width:1px" />.)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>9.&nbsp; What you own is not who YOU are.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Stuff really is just stuff, and it has absolutely no bearing on who you are as a person.&nbsp; Most of us can make do with much less than we think we need.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a valuable reminder, especially in a hugely consumer-driven culture that focuses more on material things than meaningful connections and experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have to create your own culture.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t watch TV, don&rsquo;t read every fashion magazine, and don&rsquo;t consume too much of the evening news.&nbsp; Find the strength to fill your time with meaningful experiences.&nbsp; The space and time you are occupying at this very moment is LIFE, and if you&rsquo;re worrying about Kim Kardashian or Lebron James or some other famous face, then you are disempowered.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re giving your life away to marketing and media trickery, which is created by big companies to ultimately motivate you to want to dress a certain way, look a certain way, and be a certain way.&nbsp; This is tragic, this kind of thinking.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all just Hollywood brainwashing.&nbsp; What is real is YOU and your friends and your family, your loves, your highs, your hopes, your plans, your fears, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Too often we&rsquo;re told that we&rsquo;re not important, we&rsquo;re just peripheral to what is.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get a degree, get a job, get a car, get a house, and keep on getting.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s sad, because someday you&rsquo;ll wake up and realize you&rsquo;ve been tricked.&nbsp; And all you&rsquo;ll want then is to reclaim your mind by getting it out of the hands of the brainwashers who want to turn you into a drone that buys everything that isn&rsquo;t needed to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.marcandangel.com/2013/11/24/7-reasons-to-stop-proving-yourself-to-everyone-else/">impress everyone that isn&rsquo;t important</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>10.&nbsp; Everything changes, every second.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Embrace change and realize it happens for a reason.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t always be obvious at first, but in the end it will be worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What you have today may become what you had by tomorrow.&nbsp; You never know.&nbsp; Things change, often spontaneously.&nbsp; People and circumstances come and go.&nbsp; Life doesn&rsquo;t stop for anybody.&nbsp; It moves rapidly and rushes from calm to chaos in a matter of seconds, and happens like this to people every day.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s likely happening to someone nearby right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes the shortest split second in time changes the direction of our lives.&nbsp; A seemingly innocuous decision rattles our whole world like a meteorite striking Earth.&nbsp; Entire lives have been swiveled and flipped upside down, for better or worse, on the strength of an unpredictable event.&nbsp; And these events are always happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However good or bad a situation is now, it will change.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the one thing you can count on.&nbsp; So when life is good, enjoy it.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t go looking for something better every second.&nbsp; Happiness never comes to those who don&rsquo;t appreciate what they have while they have it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Your turn&hellip;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>What else would you add to this list?&nbsp; What important life lessons do you often forget?&nbsp; Leave a comment below and share your thoughts.</p>\r\n', '2015-10-29 22:01:18', '10 Painfully Obvious Truths Everyone Forgets Too Soon', '');
